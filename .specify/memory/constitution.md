# Spec-Dev Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code MUST adhere to strict quality standards: Clean, readable, and maintainable code with 
consistent formatting and naming conventions. Code reviews are mandatory with at least one 
approval required. Static analysis tools MUST pass without warnings. Documentation is 
required for all public APIs, complex algorithms, and architectural decisions.

**Rationale**: High-quality code reduces bugs, improves maintainability, and enables team 
scalability. Quality gates prevent technical debt accumulation.

### II. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory: Tests MUST be written before implementation. All code 
MUST have minimum 80% test coverage. Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests 
are required based on component complexity. Tests MUST be fast, reliable, and deterministic.

**Rationale**: TDD ensures robust design, prevents regressions, and provides living 
documentation. Comprehensive testing builds confidence for rapid iteration.

### III. User Experience Consistency
User interfaces MUST follow established design systems and interaction patterns. Performance 
requirements: <200ms response times for interactive elements, <3s page load times. 
Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) is mandatory. Cross-platform consistency MUST be 
maintained across all supported devices and browsers.

**Rationale**: Consistent UX reduces cognitive load, improves user satisfaction, and 
ensures inclusive access. Performance directly impacts user retention.

### IV. Performance by Design
Performance considerations MUST be integrated from the design phase. Monitoring and profiling 
tools are required for all production systems. Performance budgets MUST be established and 
monitored: API response times <500ms p95, memory usage <2GB per service, CPU utilization <70% 
under normal load. Performance regressions trigger immediate investigation.

**Rationale**: Performance is a feature, not an afterthought. Poor performance degrades user 
experience and increases operational costs.

## Quality Standards

Code quality tools and processes are standardized across all projects:
- Linting and formatting tools configured consistently
- Pre-commit hooks for quality checks
- Automated dependency vulnerability scanning
- Regular code quality metrics reporting
- Refactoring cycles scheduled quarterly

## Development Workflow

All development follows a structured workflow:
- Feature specifications MUST be approved before implementation
- Branch protection rules enforce review requirements
- Continuous Integration validates all quality gates
- Deployment requires successful test suite execution
- Post-deployment monitoring confirms performance targets

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
1. Documented proposal with rationale
2. Team review and approval process
3. Migration plan for existing code
4. Version increment following semantic versioning

All pull requests and code reviews MUST verify constitutional compliance. Complexity 
introductions MUST be justified with clear business value. Teams MUST use established 
templates and processes for consistency.
